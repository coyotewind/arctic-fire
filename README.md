# JS Todo or Not Todo App

### Description

- A functioning To-Do app to see pending, completed, and expired to dos.
- It can be seen at https://arctic-fire.netlify.app/

### What I Learned:

- Our first foray into JSON stringfy and parse.
- Use of local storage to make user preferences persistent

### What I am Proud Of:

- Used local storage to make the state of our todos persist when the screen was refreshed.
- Used local storage to save the user preferences like "dark mode" versus "light mode".

### How I Would Uplevel It:

- I would make the todo cards drag and drop similar to Jira or Trello
